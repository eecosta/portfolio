Hello! I am an experienced Speech Pathologist and communication disorder professional with over 3 years of proven expertise in speech pathology and communication disorders. 


With skills in linguistics, speech fluency, cognitive-communicative disorders, and aural rehabilitation, I am able to treat communication disorders, and achieve proper communication within patients. I am adept at using Excel, Google Workspace, and Python.
