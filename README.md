### Grade Calculator

 This project was to make a grade calculator for two of my current classes. Using Excel, I was able to input all of my grades from the semester and how much they are each worth in order to get a predicted value for my final grade.

 The objective of this project was to create a budget tracker in Excel. I researched different outboard boats for sale, and used Excel to assess the profit one would make in the buying or selling of these boats.

 Here, I used a given set of data regarding the relationship (or lack thereof) between temperature and the amount of times a cricket chirps. I was able to find that the data was significantly significant because there was a very small p-value.
